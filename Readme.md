## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

* This plugin is currently in a working PoC stage.
* As the Burp Montoya API does not provide all necessary functions, I'm still struggling with proper extraction of intruder payloads.
* I'm not sure about response time values - not properly tested
* Tbeen tested on **Windows** with **Firefox** only

## üìÖ Future Works (One Day, Maybe)

* Add payload values
* Implement more filters (e.g., "payload reflected," "encoded payload reflected").
* Improve the UX when working with the histogram.
* Implement diff analysis on multiple responses (I've already tested some approaches with LLMs).
